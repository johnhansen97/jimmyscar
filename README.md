## Welcome to Jimmy's Car!
### (Website Edition)

This repo has been made to help facilitate building a website for the Jimmy's Car playlist/game/thing.

The application is built with Ruby on Rails. Check the link [here](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10) for the tutorial I used to install Rails in Windows 10. The website should also have tutorials for other OSes and versions.

I use MySql to interact with the database for this app since that's the db-interaction software I have used to work with Ruby apps. See the `db_schema` folder for a schema planned for this database. As of the last version of `README.md`, the database has not been completely filled out.

The `wireframes` folder contains a series of drawn-out plans for pages in the app. As of the last version of `README.md`, the app does not implement the given wireframes.

Run the app locally on your own computer once Rails is set up by using the command:
```
    > rails s
```

Then, navigate to `localhost:3000` to reach the app. As of the last version of `README.md`, the app does not have a reachable url on the greater Internet.
